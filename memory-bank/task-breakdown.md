- Need to add scroll snap functionality while maintaining existing setup

## Mobile Scroll Snap Implementation Notes

### Problem Identified

- Scroll snap can cause poor UX on mobile devices
- Touch scrolling conflicts with snap behavior
- Inconsistent behavior across mobile browsers
- Momentum scrolling interference

### Solution Applied

- Used CSS media queries for responsive scroll snap
- `@media (min-width: 768px)` for desktop/tablet only
- Removed scroll snap properties from mobile breakpoint
- Maintained all other styling and functionality
- Simple, maintainable, cross-browser solution

### Technical Details

- Modified `.scroll-snap-container` class
- Modified `.section` class scroll-snap-align property
- Used 768px breakpoint (standard tablet/desktop threshold)
- Preserved vendor prefixes for older browser support
- No JavaScript required - pure CSS solution

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers: Full scroll snap support on desktop
- Mobile browsers: Natural scrolling behavior
- Legacy browsers: Graceful degradation with vendor prefixes
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained
