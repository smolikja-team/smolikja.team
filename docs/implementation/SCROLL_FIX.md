# 🔧 Scroll Navigation Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Projects Page Scroll Behavior

### **🐛 Problem:**
- When on the Projects page, scrolling down was incorrectly navigating back to HomePage
- Users couldn't scroll within the Projects page content normally
- The scroll controller was preventing all scroll events and treating them as page navigation

### **🎯 Root Cause:**
The `handleWheel()` method in `scrollController.js` was:
1. Always calling `event.preventDefault()` on ALL wheel events
2. Treating every scroll as inter-page navigation
3. Not checking if the current page has scrollable content

### **🛠️ Solution Implemented:**

#### **Smart Scroll Detection:**
```javascript
// Check if current page has scrollable content
const scrollableElement = currentPage.querySelector('.ProjectsPage');

if (scrollableElement) {
    const { scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeight } = scrollableElement;
    const isAtTop = scrollTop === 0;
    const isAtBottom = Math.abs(scrollHeight - clientHeight - scrollTop) < 1;
    
    // Only navigate between pages when at boundaries
    if ((delta < 0 && isAtTop) || (delta > 0 && isAtBottom)) {
        // Navigate to previous/next page
    }
    // Otherwise allow normal scrolling
}
```

#### **Boundary-Based Navigation:**
- **Scroll up** when **already at top** → Navigate to previous page
- **Scroll down** when **already at bottom** → Navigate to next page  
- **Scroll within content** → Allow normal page scrolling

#### **Consistent Touch Handling:**
- Applied the same logic to touch/swipe events
- Created separate `handleTouch()` method with identical boundary checking

### **📱 Behavior Now:**

#### **HomePage:**
- ✅ Scroll/swipe navigation works normally (no scrollable content)
- ✅ Navigate to Projects page on scroll down

#### **Projects Page:**
- ✅ **Normal scrolling within page content** 
- ✅ Navigate to HomePage only when scrolling up from the very top
- ✅ Navigate to next page only when scrolling down from the very bottom
- ✅ Touch/swipe gestures follow the same logic

### **🎨 User Experience:**
- **Natural scrolling** within Projects page content
- **Intuitive navigation** only at page boundaries  
- **Consistent behavior** across mouse wheel, keyboard, and touch
- **No unwanted navigation** when browsing project cards

### **📋 Technical Details:**
- **Files Modified:** `src/js/scrollController.js`
- **Methods Updated:** `handleWheel()`, `bindEvents()`
- **Methods Added:** `handleTouch()`
- **Scroll Detection:** Uses `scrollTop`, `scrollHeight`, `clientHeight`
- **Boundary Tolerance:** 1px tolerance for bottom detection (handles sub-pixel rendering)

The fix ensures that users can now scroll normally within the Projects page while maintaining the smooth inter-page navigation experience!
