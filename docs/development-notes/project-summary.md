### Video Implementation - Final Version

- **Foreground Video**: Clean autoplay looped video as the main content in intro section

- **Object-fit**: contain (as requested) for proper aspect ratio preservation
- **Mobile Compatibility**: playsinline attribute for iOS Safari support
- **Performance**: Hardware acceleration and optimized rendering

- Will-change property for optimized rendering
- Responsive sizing for all device types
- Standard appearance property for browser compatibility

### Technical Implementation

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.2 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Tailwind CSS integration
- **Scroll Snap**: CSS scroll-snap-type: y mandatory (desktop only)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with clamp() functions and dvh units
- **Performance**: Optimized with Next.js built-in optimizations
- **Client Component**: Using "use client" directive for video event handlers
- **Mobile UX**: Scroll snap disabled on devices < 768px width

### Files Modified/Created

1. `app/page.tsx` - Main page component with 3 sections
2. `app/globals.css` - Enhanced with responsive scroll snap and mobile optimizations
3. `memory-bank/` - Documentation and task tracking system

### Key CSS Features

- Responsive scroll snap (desktop: enabled, mobile: disabled)
- Responsive grid layouts for projects and about sections
- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Hover effects on cards and interactive elements
- Mobile-responsive typography using clamp()
- Content-adaptive section heights to prevent overflow
- Cross-browser scroll snap support with vendor prefixes

### Mobile Scroll Snap Solution

**Problem Solved**: Scroll snap behavior can be problematic on mobile devices due to:

- Touch scrolling conflicts
- Browser inconsistencies
- Poor user experience with momentum scrolling

**Solution Implemented**:

- Used `@media (min-width: 768px)` to enable scroll snap only on desktop/tablet
- Disabled `scroll-snap-type` and `scroll-snap-align` on mobile devices
- Maintained all other styling and functionality
- Simple, clean implementation using CSS media queries

### Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Modern browsers with CSS scroll-snap support
- ✅ Fallback for older browsers with vendor prefixes
- ✅ Mobile browsers with natural scrolling behavior
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Desktop)

### Development Server

- Running on: <http://localhost:3001>
- Ready for production deployment

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

- Add smooth scroll animations between sections
- Implement scroll progress indicator
- Add contact form in About section
- Include project detail modals
- Add dark/light theme toggle
- Implement lazy loading for better performance
